Excited to share my latest project as a BI Consultant for BlackTECH Pizza, a Canadian-inspired pizza place in Ontario!

Using a dataset of 4 tables covering a year’s worth of sales, I developed a data model to uncover key insights on operations, sales, and revenue. 📊

Key Insights Delivered:
🔍 Sales Analysis: Identified best-selling pizzas, seasonal trends, and high-margin items.
🔍 Operational Efficiency: Pinpointed peak ordering times to optimize staffing and kitchen workflow.
🔍 Product Optimization: Analyzed pizza categories and ingredient usage to refine the menu.

The Result?
A dynamic dashboard showcasing:
✔️ Total Revenue & Sales Trends
✔️ Top Products & Customer Preferences
✔️ Operational Insights for smoother processes

This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights that drive business success. 💡
